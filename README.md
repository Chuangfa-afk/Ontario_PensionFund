# Ontario Teachers’ Pension Fund Analysis

## Project Overview
The "Ontario Teachers’ Pension Fund" project, prepared by Group F6 and presented on November 9th, 2023, offers a comprehensive analysis of the fund's portfolio allocations, risk management, and investment strategies. This project aims to align the fund's assets with its long-term objectives, considering various financial constraints and investment opportunities.

## Purpose
The objective of this analysis is to explore portfolio allocation strategies for investors with access to risk-free leverage, considering the trade-off between expected mean returns and expected portfolio standard deviation. The case study focuses on the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Planning Board (OTPPB), analyzing its asset allocation in relation to its long-term goals and financial constraints.

## Key Findings

### Portfolio Allocation Analysis (Part A)
- Analysis of risk aversion's impact on expected return and standard deviation.
- Examination of asset distribution across portfolios, highlighting the consistent ranking of assets.
- Special focus on the Global Minimum Variance (GMV) portfolio's unique stock allocation.
- Exploration of how access to a risk-free asset and short sales influence portfolio adjustments based on risk tolerance.

### Sensitivity Analysis (Part B1)
- Analysis of Mean-Variance Frontier (MVF) sensitivity to changes in asset means, standard deviations, and correlations.
- Insights into how these adjustments impact expected returns and risk assessments.

### Optimal Portfolio vs. OTPPB's Current Strategy (Part B1 & B2)
- Comparison of OTPPB's current equity investment with the optimal portfolio for a 5% real return target.
- Recommendations for a more realistic return target to align with long-term goals without increasing contribution rates.
- Discussion of demographic assumptions impacting pension fund investment, including retirement age and life expectancy.

## Conclusions
The project concludes that OTPPB's current asset allocation may not align with its stated goal of achieving a 5% real return. A revised return target of 6% is recommended based on the analysis, which considers the least negative return outcomes and demographic variations.

## Methodology
This comprehensive study utilized various financial analysis tools and techniques, including mean-variance analysis, portfolio optimization, and sensitivity analysis, to evaluate and recommend optimal asset allocation strategies for the OTPPB.
